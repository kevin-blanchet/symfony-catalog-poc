# symfony-catalog-poc
A simple fictional catalog of shoes and T-shirts

The goal is to discover symfony, doctrine and API platform
Objectives:
  Creating the database with doctrine
  Creating forms to browse the catalog (front-office)
  Creating a login system
  Creating forms to add products to the catalog (back-office)
  Exposing the catalog via API
  
The app uses symfony server to allow for easy and local deployment and is not designed for production
The app uses a local mySQL environment. I will try to make the data dump files available once the project is over

Issues:
  The mySQL server driver could not be found. Fix: uncommented a line in my local PHP install php.ini file
